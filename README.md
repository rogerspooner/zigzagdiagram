# Zig Zag Diagram

JavaScript that loads two CSV files and draws an SVG diagram.
The diagram show railway stations as horizontal lines on the Y axis.
Time is along the X axis.
A scheduled train is a diagonal line from a station (Y) at a departure time (X) to another X,Y point.
This helps to see the time available for connections, and alternatives.

I drew it to help me visualise a day I am planning with an Interrail pass. I need to get from one of two starting points, via a special railway section, to a destination the next day (within the Interrail rules). How many chances do I get for mistakes?
